# code for fMRI experiments in my dissertation project  
Experiment 1 is 12 runs of object viewing for google quickdraw sketches (6 runs) and photographic images (6 runs) as well as 4 runs of a localizer developed by David Pitcher and Nancy Kanwisher  
Experiment 2 is 4 runs of 8s videos and 12 runs of looped (x3) 2s videos of ambiguous objects generated by RNNs trained over human sketches from 2 object categoris in the quickdraw dataset. In the first 4 runs, participants pushed a button to indicate when they perceived the sketch as a particular object and then reported which object they saw (one of the two categories over which the RNN was trained or something else) at the end of the clip. In the next 12 runs participants were instructed to attempt to see the ambiguous sketch as its animate or inanimate alternative (again, one of the training categories) or to passively view the sketches.
